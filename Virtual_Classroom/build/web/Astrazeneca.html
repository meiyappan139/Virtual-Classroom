         <h2>Interview Tips</h2>
         <h2></h2>
        <pre>
             Be clear about what you are and what you want. 

             Most importantly They don’t have any explicit coding round. 

             You’ve to be very clear with concepts.

             Be confident in your answers. All the best. 

           <b>Aptitude Tests</b>

              There are three types of test you will be asked to complete: numerical, verbal and logical reasoning tests.

             <b> Numerical reasoning tests.</b> 

                  Most positions at Astra Zeneca require skills in numeracy, from reading graphs in finance through to interpreting statistics in marketing. 

                  The numerical reasoning test will assess your skills in these areas. 

                  Most of the questions will be in the multiple-choice format: you will be presented with a set of statistics and asked questions, 
                  or you may be expected to calculate percentages. 

                  There are strict time limits imposed on these tests, so working quickly and accurately is important.

              <b>Verbal reasoning tests. </b>

                  Candidates will be presented with a set of paragraphs and asked to assess whether sets of 
                  corresponding statements are true, false or whether you cannot say. 

                  The aim of this test is to assess your analytical capabilities and evaluate your skills in spelling and grammar.

              <b>Logical reasoning tests. </b>

                  The final test in the series will provide a series of sequences of shapes or patterns. 

                  For each, candidates need to identify missing steps or answer what shape will appear next in the sequence. These tests are 
                  good indicators of your aptitude for problem solving and analysis

            <b>Presentation</b>

                 For the graduate programme and certain vacancies, you may be asked to prepare and give a presentation.

                 At the Astra Zeneca assessment centre, you will be provided with the topic shortly before you have to 
                 give your presentation. 

                 After being given the topic, you will be allowed a period to prepare and create some prompts 
                 to take with you into the presentation.

                 The interview panel will be assessing how well you communicate information, your ability to engage 
                 with the audience, and your capacity to work under pressure. 

                 Acquiring thorough knowledge of the company and its background in advance will give you a great
                  advantage in this activity.
