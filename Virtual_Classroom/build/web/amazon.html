         <h2>Interview Experience</h2>
         <h2></h2>
        <pre>
          <b>Amazon visited our campus around late September to hire for the role of Software Developer Intern. 

             There were 3 rounds involved in the process.</b>


              *An online test
              *Two technical interviews.
             
            The online test was organized on Mettl Platform and consisted of the following parts :

           <b>Debugging:</b> 

                Had to apply some changes to a given code snippet to make it logically and syntactically correct.
            Psychometric Test: Situational questions.

           <b>Reasoning:</b> 

                Was relatively easier than you would usually find in other placement tests.
            
           <b>Two coding questions :</b> 
              
              Rewrite of Search in a matrix:<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/"> Click here</a>
              Rewrite of Bridges in a graph: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/bridge-in-a-graph/">Click here</a>
            
            <b>Technical Round 1:</b>

            Started with the introduction.
            
            <b>Then two coding questions were asked :</b>
                 
                  Given the data of n buses in a bus station with their arrival and departure time, find the minimum number  of platforms required
                  so that none of the buses overlap: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimum-number-platforms-required-railwaybus-station/">Click</a>

                  Gave an O(nlogn) solution by sorting all the timings.

                  Given a binary matrix, find the number of shapes and their parameter (length) present in the matrix. A shape is a sequence of consecutive ones,
                  and we can move in all eight directions:<a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/find-number-of-islands/">Click</a> 
            
                  Solved using BFS.
                  Discussion on time and space complexities of each problem.
            
            <b>Technical Round 2 :</b>

                  Again started with the introduction and simple questions related to one of my projects.
           
            <b>Then 2 coding questions :</b>

                   Given the prices of n stocks find the maximum profit that can be made by doing at most k transactions:
                   <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/maximum-profit-by-buying-and-selling-a-share-at-most-k-times/">Click</a> 
              
                   First I gave an O(n3) DP solution, then optimized it to O(n2).
                  
                   Given the heights of walls arranged from left to right find the volume of water that will be trapped between the walls: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/trapping-rain-water/">Click</a>
                  
                   Gave an O(n) solution using the maximum wall to right and left for each wall.
                    
                   Discussion on time and space complexities for each problem.
