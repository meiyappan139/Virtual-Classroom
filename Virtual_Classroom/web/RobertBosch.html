                including the pre-placement talk.</b>

             <b>Pre-Placement Talk:</b> 

                Everyone who wants to sincerely seat for placement must attend the talk. Most of the questions in the HR Round will revolve around whatever is

                The test was conducted on the Hirepro platform. It had three sections for 
                Computer Science students with a 25% negative marking and all the sections were compulsory.

             <b>Technical (35 questions, 35 minutes):</b>

                In this section, questions were asked based on the concepts of Object-Oriented 
                Programming, Data Structures & Algorithms, Computer Networks, Database Management System, Computer Organisation & Architecture, and Microcontroller.

             <b>Aptitude (25 questions, 25 minutes):</b>

                In this section, the knowledge on Time & Work, Profit & Loss, HCF-LCM, 
                Reading Comprehension, Probability, Permutations & Combinations, Series, 
                Logical Arrangements, and Mixtures & Alligations were tested.

            <b>Coding (2 questions, 30 minutes):</b>

                Coding questions were of basic level. The first question was to find the difference 
                between the inputted number and its reverse. The second question was an array-based question 
                to count and find the sum of numbers in array which are powers of two.

            <b>Round 2 (Technical Interview):</b> 

                Some basic questions about my background was asked. It was continued with the 
                discussion based on my projects mentioned in my resume. I was tested for some basic concepts of DBMS and 
                Programming Languages like C++, Python and Java. I was asked to solve two questions 
                in all this three languages. The first questions was to sort an alphanumeric string 
                in decending order of their ASCII/UNICODE values. The second question was to input a 
                string with spaces and print each character in a new row. At last few questions based 
                on the Data Mining concepts were asked which was part of the project mentioned in my resume.

            <b>Round 3 (HR Round):</b> 

               It started with my introduction and my family background. Further a short discussion on my 
               projects and the learning outcomes (apart from academics) were asked. My knowledge about 
               Bosch was tested throughout this session and attending the pre-placement talk helped me 
               to ace this round. Some questions asked during this rounds were:
      
              1)Why Computer Science?

              2)Why this college?
              
              3)Why Bosch?
