        <h2>Interview Process</h2>
        <pre>
        
        Interview Rounds
        
        <b>Round 1:</b>

          The very first round was a written aptitude test. The quantitative aptitude and English questions were very easy.

        <b>Round 2: </b>

        The second round was a group discussion round. 

        I was not feeling too confident about it as I am not a great public speaker. But I played a trick by observing a boy who was not talking sense at all. 

        I allowed that person to finish before I started speaking. Showing etiquette properly actually earned me points in the GD round. 

        Besides doing that, I offered some valuable points on life ethics. Ours was a group of 15 and luckily 12 of us got selected, including me!
 
         <b>Round 3:</b>

        Third round was the HR round. I assumed that the HR lady meant to ask me “Tell me something that is not included in your resume.”

         However, the actual question was “Chetan, tell me about yourself.” 

         I understood what she meant and I nailed it. I spoke to her confidently and did not bluff or lie.

      <b>Round 4:</b>

        The fourth round was conducted at the company office. I was interviewed by the CEO cum Director himself. Eventually, I got selected for the SAP profile. 

        Questions asked to me were “Tell be about yourself”, “What are your interests?” etc. To answer the second question, I told him that I want to become a software developer. 

        Surprised, Sir inquired, “What if we have two posts – a developer’s position and an SAP implementation position, for which you are here. 

        What will be your choice?” I frankly replied that I would go with the developer position.
        About 5 minutes later I was called by the HR lady. 

        She said I had been selected for the SAP position. 

        I was upset as but the HR lady assured me that they will try to absorb me into ET, which is the software development branch of NEEYAMO. Thus, I agreed to join!

      <b>Round 5:</b>

       My fifth round was a technical one. It was a pen and paper round and I was given 7 questions. I had been asked to solve any 3 questions. 

       These were programming questions. 

       They seemed easy and I was able to solve 3 questions within the agreed time limit. Since time still remained, I solved more 2.
      
      <b>Round 6:</b>

      I was called back again for a 6th round. 

      This was a technical HR round. 

      I was asked to solve small programs on the spot and write the logic on paper. 

      I was also asked questions based on technologies used these days.

      <b>Round 7:</b> 

      Then I was called again for a 7th round. 

      This was a telephonic round. 

      My resume had been sent to a location via fax and the interviewer on asked me questions on phone, based on my resume.
      Finally, an HR lady asked me to come down to office and collect my offer letter.

         <h2>Interview Experience</h2>
         <h2></h2>
        <pre>
         
         Be well prepared. 

         Have good communication skills in English.

         Afterall, English is an integral part of today’s world. If you are good in English and aptitude, you will for sure land the job!

        When preparing for the technical rounds, don’t be bookish. Stress more on practical application of logic. And also, try to think out of the box. 

        Organizations these days are not looking for knowledgeable employees, rather they prefer people who can apply whatever little knowledge they have into good use.

        Also, try and prove that you are special and you have got something special to offer, they need the most.

        <b>Follow these ethics as your thumb rule in every interview:</b>

        1.Observe – Watch everyone closely
        2.Listen – Note what each has to say
        3.Cooperate – Show that you are a good team member and you can support your team. Give examples.
        4.Speak cautiously – In a GD round, if someone is not speaking or is having trouble to say something, make everyone pause and let that person speak. 

        This shows that you value everyone’s opinion.
