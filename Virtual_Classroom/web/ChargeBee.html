                1)To check whether a hour glass is fully filled or not. Function must return 1 if full 
                and 0 if not where n >=5 (n is the number of lines)
                * – – – *
                * – *
                *

                    Given sentence : mississippi River
                    result : the counter array
                    i=1;
                    p-1;
                    r=1;
                    s=1;

            <b>Round 3:(coding)</b>

         <h2>Sample Questions asked in ChargeBee</h2>
         <h2></h2>
        <pre>
         

            1.Given an array and a set of operations on it, perform those in sequence to the array.
                
                Example: given array : 12345
                Operations to be performed in order : L1,R2,R1,L3
                L1 : shift left once,R2 : shift right twice…etc

            2.Given an array of size n of integer type containing the integers from 1 to n (both including),
              print how many times each integer is repeated. There is no rule that every integer in the range 
              1 to n will be present in the array. Solve the problem using only one additional variable.
                
                Example: n= 5
                Array : 12341
                Answer : 1 – 2 times
                2 – 1 time
                3 – 1 time
                4 – 1 time

            3. Print this pattern
                * * * * *
                * * *
                *
                * * *
                * * * * *

            4. A code is given which prints the sum of even and odd numbers in the given set of numbers.
               Identify the error and rectify it.


            5. Given two integers m and n,write code for m power n without using exponent operation.

            6. Doubly linked list insertion and deletion.

            7. Measure 9 min using two 4 min and 7 min sand glass.

            8. 2 DBMS queries.(don’t remember)
