        <h2>Interview Process</h2>
        <pre>
            <b>Round: Test</b>

            <b>Experience:</b> 

              The questions were of medium to high difficulty. 

              What set this test apart was the fact that each question had different weightage ranging from 0.5 to 3 marks per question. Time was a major factor. 

              So my strategy was to attempt all the 1 and 1.5 marks questions which constitute the major chunk of the paper in around 40 minutes 
              and spend the remaining 20 minutes for the 2 and 3 mark questions. I did not even bother reading the 0.5 mark 
              questions. 

              The 2 and 3 mark questions were difficult and those will differentiate you from others. 1600 students wrote the test and only 86 got shortlisted 
              for the next round.

              Duration: 60 minutes
              Total Questions: 40

    
            <b>Round: Technical Interview</b>

              Experience: 

              I was asked to write a C program to print the Fibonacci sequence and a basic SQL query. Apart from this I was asked a puzzle and other 
              questions related to my resume. 

              Out of the 86, only 26 students were called for the next round which again was a technical interview.

            <b>Round: Technical Interview</b>

              Experience: This was similar to the first technical interview. I had to write a C program to print the prime numbers between 1 and 100 
              and a puzzle was asked again. 

              Apart from this a guesstimate to find the number of cars between 2 places was asked and a scenario based question too was asked. 

              These were followed by resume related questions.

            <b>Round: HR Interview</b>

              Experience: All the 26 students who attended the second technical round were allowed to attend HR round as well. 

              This was just for 4 - 5 minutes. 

              I was asked about my family background and why I should be hired. My fondest memories from school days were asked too. 

              Finally offer letter was given to 10 students out of the 1600 who wrote the test :P


<b>General Tips: Just keep a calm head and attempt the questions. Ask for time to think if you are not able to answer the questions immediately. 
Be bold and confident. That is sufficient :)</b>

Skills: Puzzle Solving Capability, Ability To Think, SQL, C Programming
