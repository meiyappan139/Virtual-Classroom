        <h2>Interview Process</h2>
        <pre>
          
          <b>There were three rounds of interview.</b> 

          1.First the technical Interview 

          2.the Managerial Round. 

          These two were Face to face. 

          3.Then the HR Round which was telephonic.

          <b>Mindtree Technical Interview</b>

          The MindTree technical interview questions vary depending on the background of the candidate. 

          Refreshing subjects from as early as your first year might be prudent as the detailed Mindtree interview questions will usually revolve around 
          the subjects depending upon on the branch of the respective candidates. In general, the following general topics are asked of candidates.

          1.Data Structures

          2.Algorithms and Logic
          
          3.Files and Storage
          
          4.Operators and Processors
          
          5.Database management systems
          
          6.Networks and Connections
          
          7.Coding Problems

          The trick to cracking any technical interview is to stay calm under pressure, and have a cool head on your shoulders. 

          It is okay to say I don't know to a question rather than cooking up a story that will waste the interviewers time. Stay calm, stay cool, and be thorough.


         <b>Mindtree HR Interview</b>

          The MindTree HR interview questions usually revolve around the personality and history of the candidate. 

          The questions will always vary depending on the panel, but a few of the common topics are;

          1) Background
          2) Family
          3) Hobbies and Passions
          4) Strengths and Weaknesses
          5) Achievements

        There is no 'cracking' an HR interview per se. 

        The goal of an HR interview is to get to know you and to ascertain whether everything mentioned on your resume is true or not. 

        It also serves a goal for the panel to check whether the candidate will be a good cultural fit for the company.

         <h2>Interview Experience</h2>
         <h2></h2>
        <pre>
          
          After the written test, I was selected for the interview round.

          My interviewer asked me 4 questions and also asked me to code all of them after discussing the solution.

          The first question was about sorting in a 2D array.

          The second question was to about the functions of a binary tree.
          
          The third question was similar to the second question (they requested a further explanation in detail about my answer), the interviewer 
          thought of the question because of my answer, but because I knew the concept properly, that question wasn't a problem for me.
          
          The final question was to about linked list.
          
          The interviewer gave me a problem and asked me to explain the logic. Once that was done, he asked me to write the logic (in code) for the same.

          After that, I moved on to the HR interview. 

          The HR interview was very easy. 

          The interviewers made me feel comfortable, and it was a general discussion about my family and my hobbies. They also enquired about my location preference. 

          My HR interview was relatively short, it was over in less than 10 minutes.
